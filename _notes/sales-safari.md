## Why Safari matters

-   Everything in business is marketing

Marketing isn&rsquo;t something that you add later&#x2026;

to **attract** people
to **persuade** people
to **serve** people

marketing isn&rsquo;t just promotion

> The purpose of buisness is to create and keep a customer

You need to understand your market

You need to `read their mind`

### What Alex noticed/did that I didn&rsquo;t

<https://share.getcloudapp.com/YEuo0mJz>

-   What do I notice about these notes?
    They are organized under Pain, Recommendation, Jargon
    
    A little more shorthand than mine
    have quotes for someone else&rsquo;s words
    vs
    just your notes on what they are saying

-   organization:
    Pain
    Recommendations
    Jargon

**The way the break jargon down as tags is really cool**

Whole sentances
Specific words

editoralizing vs what they said

## Techniques for 2 & 3 safari


<a id="orgafdcf5a"></a>

### 3 ingredients to speak their language

1.  Pain

    Pain is made of&#x2026;
    
    -   the facts: outcome / situation
        &ldquo;I want good looking cabinets without paying to replace them&rdquo;
        
        the outcome they want or the outcome that got but didn&rsquo;t want
        
        looking for shortcuts - indicator of pain
    
    -   the feelings around it
        &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m anxious about the effort, AND unsure if these products work.&rdquo;
    
    -   the actions/behaviors triggered
    
    &ldquo;asking for help, procrastinating, hoping, looking for alternatives, just trying, shortcuts&rdquo;
    
    if they are always procrastinating and not doing it.. that&rsquo;s pain
    if they are asking for pain in any way - theirs pain
    
    hoping is an indicator pain.. they WANT something being a certain way

2.  Jargon

    -   specialty words, terms of art
        &ldquo;full overlay, full-stack, bokeh creamy anode&rdquo;
        
        mean something very specific to the group but not anything to people outside of the group
    -   insider lingo
        &ldquo;normal words used in an unusual way inside a community&rdquo;
        
        If you use insider lingo incorrectly, it screams NOT ONE OF US
        
        `Tribalism is real`
        
        Get used to noting all the words your peers use that others wouldn&rsquo;t know

3.  Recommendations

    More subtle than Jargon not as subtle as pain
    
    -   advice
        &ldquo;do this, try this, did you try this, experience says&#x2026;&rdquo;
        &ldquo;also do NOT do this/try this&rdquo;
    -   references
        &ldquo;read this, listen to this, check out this person&#x2026;&rdquo;
    -   products
        &ldquo;buy this, don&rsquo;t buy this&#x2026;&rdquo;
        &ldquo;I bought this and&#x2026;&rdquo;
        
        Products are good indicators. Make note of prices!
    
    `If you search for specific data, you'll likely get what you want but you won't get what you don't know`
    
    Won&rsquo;t know where specific data sits in the hierarchy of data
    
    There&rsquo;s an order of operations here
    
    -   **Sales Safari:** The term is used because you want to go to where people are acting naturally, not a zoo where interaction is forced (already a customer, asking &rsquo;what&rsquo;s your problem&rsquo;)
        
        cold-calls.. people want to helpful and don&rsquo;t give their actual pains
        
        **Not a performance**
    -   **Watering hole:** Places that your audience congregates to talk amongst themselves

        # Pain
        the posters' pains (current, past, implied)
        
        # Jargon
        terms of art, technical lingo, community phrases
        
        # Recommendations
        advice what to buy, read, share, try... or NOT to

### Next

1 note per safari
There are best practices for sharing E-bomb with people in safari threads you find

Safari is about framing the way you see data.
Safari is not optimized on purpose - DONT optimize!

It&rsquo;s like cheating in the gym- make the movement easier so you can do more.. but you won&rsquo;t get results

It&rsquo;s more about how your brain processes than the data you collection

The internet is full of information, the problem is not enough information - it&rsquo;s how you process it

Most people won&rsquo;t use their brain

This won&rsquo;t feel right the first 20-30 times you do it. You feel like you&rsquo;re doing it wrong, BEACUSE YOU ARE! but you will get better

**I didn&rsquo;t know what I was looking for but I know what I found**

# Sales Safari Round 2 Smelly Water

[ss: Smelly Water](egghead lesson: s_smelly_water.md)

You don&rsquo;t need to qualify if information is good or not
How many times?
When patterns show up. Keep doing safari but notice different patterns

practice hanging out on forums. Hang out with a purpose


<a id="org8d9b838"></a>

# Amy doing Safari

First thing: Set up with the template

Went through and did just pain at first
any pain.

Clarifying questions can be implied recommendations

Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it
You want to know what your customers are reading, sharing, recommending, and buying

watering holes are everywhere! You don&rsquo;t need to find an amazing thread to start

If the OP is asking questions, there is pain!

You have a ton of advantages by being in your lane. Use the knowledge that you got. Stay in your lane!

If your not fully in a lane, pick one.


<a id="orgb064d01"></a>

# What to do with this data

&ldquo;Why are they posting this?&rdquo;

No one was upset. just because someone isn&rsquo;t emotional, doesn&rsquo;t mean they are not experiencing pain.

If someone is posting a question, there is a reason. It implies pain.

`Hope is a smoke signal of pain`

E-bombs are strategically free.. loop them into your world

E-bomb is an answer to someones pain.


<a id="org8fb5441"></a>

# Sales Safari Round 3 Amazon cat poop

[ss: Amazon cat poop review](egghead lesson: ss_amazon_cat_poop_review.md)

How to think about jargon?
Jargon is a pain point. It&rsquo;s vague
Jargon is not just a secret squirrel code word

the recommendation of improving a thing that you don&rsquo;t have made Daniel and Jonah want a cat (It&rsquo;s powerful when you connect with an offered solution)

Dont assume you know what people are talking about (that all liter is crystals)

People are paying 140 for this product and 30-40$ on cartriges a month on a product that has flaws

Every product creates new pains which gives you opportunities

You don&rsquo;t need to create a perfect solution

&ldquo;ahh my market is saturated&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s saturated with products that create pain, don&rsquo;t let that deture you!


<a id="org365e77c"></a>

# Amy doing Safari

include positive comments as well - imply what the pain is or could be

how the user talks about their cat
writes concise pain and adds a bit of context with ()

ordered by oldest


<a id="org948d8ac"></a>

# Discussion

You don&rsquo;t have to get it all
Getting any data is better than none

look at the thread as if it were aliens

What don&rsquo;t I have yet?
What don&rsquo;t I know yet?

Safari!

&ldquo;How do I know it&rsquo;s time to buy this thing?&rdquo;

-   make an E-bomb!
    
    How many exposures do you need before you buy something?
    
    E-bombs are the way for us to build that trust and exposure to your audience
    
    E-bomb - egghead video, youtube, mailing lists emails, article
    E-bombs are strategically free
    
    When someone asks you a question, write an E-bomb on it so when more of those questions get asked&#x2026; you wrote the article a while ago and look like you know what your doing

# Q & A


<a id="org3485f7f"></a>

## This feels incomplete

this is one skill in a system. It&rsquo;s a valuable skill


<a id="org2d583c3"></a>

## Focusing on non-technical posts, How do you extract pain from to the point questions - &ldquo;How do I do X?&rdquo;

You have to learn to ferret out the implied pain.
if people are asking the same questions, then the solutions out there are not working for them

When retina screens came out.. Thomas built a workflow and detailed steps for &rsquo;retnifying your screen&rsquo;. This got downloaded 100k times and people were asking questions. Turned this into a book and made 50k

If your finding that your watering hole is giving you &rsquo;drive by question and answer&rsquo; it might not be a good watering hole to be your primary source. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that&rsquo;s not valuable. Use whats there to find other watering holes.


<a id="org0159707"></a>

## Like to organize the data - the amount of data is overwhelming

Amy has a card sorting workflow that will help with this. Teach an entire class on this


<a id="org3516973"></a>

## Difficult to find watering holes

People don&rsquo;t have to openly express pain for the pain to be there.

Ask people where the talk about &rsquo;their pains&rsquo; or the subject that you share with them

The watering holes aren&rsquo;t always the place you would hang out in
e.g. LinkedIn groups


<a id="orgfb356c9"></a>

## My audience is tight lipped

You might not have found their watering holes
or they might just be tight lipped. If they are.. If you have a problem doing sales safari on them, you&rsquo;re going to definitely have issues selling to them

Evaluate the audience youre selling to


<a id="org13aaece"></a>

## I have software skills - I don&rsquo;t know my target market to serve

`pick an audience - people who are like you, people who want to be like you, people who want to hire people like you`

peers, people who wish they were your peers, people that would hire you and your peers&ldquo;

&ldquo;front end engineers, react devs, devs who want to build - their own stores, e-commerce solutions&rdquo;

Casting a wide net dilutes your message


<a id="orgc0cf3cf"></a>

## Do you have a method for finding a watering hole for every profession?

There are search terms to find the audience. Most audiences gather online..

Think about the other places your audience is

Don&rsquo;t do sales safari on audiences you aren&rsquo;t apart of. You throw away advantages you have.

You want dialogue.

Q&A sites are good for something, not for sales safari


<a id="orgbddd43b"></a>

## How do you figure out your audience

Professional audiences

Sell to consumer audiences at your peril - not the value mindset

-   **Value Mindset:** actively look for things that save you time (which means money), make multiple of the money/effort they put into that, pay to have pains go away
    
    Some hobbyists thnk this way, some professionals think this way. Professionals think this way more often
    
    What books are people reading?
    
    Enterprise sales is much harder, you have to be more specific


<a id="org598302b"></a>

## Should I validate with my audience?

When people find something useful, that&rsquo;s validating

`Don't seek validation, seek to help`

Don&rsquo;t find the right key in the lock fit. HELP people


<a id="org05fc6ea"></a>

## What metrics should we look for fixing pain points being profitable?

What is it going to cost you? What the risk is? what the reward is

What gets you to where you want to be.

Pick a bill - try to make enough money on something that covers that.


<a id="orgcadb536"></a>

## What if you are a new member of an audience? (a new react dev to react devs)

You can do that!

Write about your struggles.


<a id="org2a8c421"></a>

## How many threads to sales safari before an E-bomb?

one thread can generate quite a few e-bombs but a lot of the time it&rsquo;s good to look at a few threads to see if a pain is consistent
