---

## Intro
- Alright so we are doing the Low Hang Power Cleans today
- I’ll show you what this looks like
- show 3 reps from the front
- show 3 reps from the side

## Points of Performance
- Let’s go over some points of performance
- For Set up, you want:
    - feet under your hips in jumping stance
    - grip a thumbs distance away from your legs
    - hook grip
- with the hang you skip the first pull so we will be focused on the second and third pull
- You’ll start by bowing over until the bar is just above your knees
    - from here your shoulders are over the bar
    - your shins are vertical
    - you’re looking straight forward
    - back tight with shoulders back
    - knuckles facing the ground
- as you extend into the power position you want to keep the bar close to you with your lats engaged
    - in power position your back is vertical
    - your feet are balanced on the ground
    - you’re ready for extension
- You’ll hit triple extension 
    - with ankles, knees and hips all extended
    - shrug
    - high pull
    - and turn over
- Feet shuffle out into a catching stance
- hip crease stays above parallel
