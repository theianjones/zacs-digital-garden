## GI tract structures

-   **[[Alimentary Canal]]:** Continuous tube that extends from the mouth to the anus through the thoracic and abdomen and pelvic cavities. aka [[Gastrointestinal Tract]]
-   **[[Salivary glands]]:** Initiates digestion of starches through enzymes

- [[Liver]]: Regulates chemical levels in the blood and excretes a product called [[Bile]].
- [[Gallbladder]]: Stores the excretions that the Liver and Pancreas excrete ([[Bile]])
- [[Pancreas]]: Excretes enzymes ([[Lipase]], [[Protease]], [[Amylase]]) that in combination with [[Bile]] help break down food
- [[Stomach]]
- [[Intestine]] (small and large)

-   **[[Microvilli]]:** the inner wall of the lumen that absorb nutrients from the small intestine
-   **[[Epithelium]]:** a border that houses different types of cells all along the GI tract. Some including squamous and columnar epithelium, endocrine cells, and immune cells
    m cells.
-   **[[Lamina Propria]]:** A connective tissue containing many blood & lymphatic vessels, immune cells

## Breakdown of food -> molecules

-   **[[Bile]]:** Partially responsible for emulsification and absorption of lipids. In other words, partially responsible for the digestion of fats to fatty acids.
-   **[[Food Bolus]]:** The initial mixture of food and Saliva
-   **[[Chyme]]:** The mixture of saliva, food, & gastric juices
-   **Polypeptides:** The broken down structure of proteins
-   **Triglycerides:** The broken down structure of fats &#x2013; cannot be absorbed by the intestine
-   **Emulsification:** the process of taking substances that wouldn&rsquo;t previously mix and mixing them
-   **[[Micelles]]:** The end result of emulsified Bile salts + monoglycerides through lipases from Fat globules so that the monoglycerides can enter the Epithelial cell layer and be absorbed

## Simple sugars

Glucose
Lactose
Sucrose
Fructose
Galactose

## Enzymes

-   **[[Lipase]]:** Combined with [[Bile]] from the [[Liver]], lipase breaks down fats into smaller and smaller molecules.
    
    Often people without enough lipase have vitamin deficiencies in fat soluble vitamins such as A, E, and K. Another clear sign would be fatty stools, which are overly foul smelling and float on top of the water in the toilet bowl.
-   **[[Protease]]:** These enzymes digest the protein in our diet into single amino acids. People struggling to break down protein can often have increased food sensitivities and allergies
-   **[[Amylase]]:** These enzymes are responsible for breaking down starches and carbs into simple sugars. Incomplete digestion of carbs can often lead to diarrhea, gas and bloating.

# Microbiome

- [[Microbiome]] - The genetic material of all the microbes - bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses - that live on and inside the human body
Germ-free mice
Antibiotics
Obesity
Asthma
Diabetes
Inflammatory bowel disease
Dietary emulsifiers
Artificial sweeteners
Malnutrition
Insulin resistance
